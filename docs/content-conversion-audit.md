# Content + Conversion Audit (Current Site)

## Snapshot diagnosis

- Impressions rising, CTR falling to near 0% in recent period.
- Existing traffic is concentrated in a small set of pages.
- High-intent pages previously seen in Search Console (`/offer`, `/resources`, `/proof`) needed stronger routing and conversion paths.

## Improvements implemented

## 1) Click-through improvements (SERP-facing)

- Updated titles/descriptions on core pages toward practical-intent language:
  - checklists
  - fixes
  - implementation outcomes
  - explicit GA4/GTM/CRM context
- Added FAQ structured data on key pages (`/ga4-attribution-problems/`, `/b2b-marketing-audit/`, `/offer/`) to improve rich-result eligibility.

## 2) Conversion-path improvements (onsite)

- Added stronger offer page hierarchy:
  - quick fit check
  - step-by-step delivery model
  - FAQs reducing friction
- Added floating/sticky booking CTA for faster action.
- Added additional decision-stage pages:
  - `/b2b-lead-generation-audit/`
  - `/b2b-content-marketing-audit/`
  - `/tracking-audit-scorecard/`
- Added secondary-language support via Italian landing page for expansion (`/it/audit-marketing-b2b/`).
- Added high-intent internal links across topic cluster pages.

## 3) Content inventory expansion

- New resource pages for near-term query capture:
  - B2B lead generation audit checklist
  - B2B content marketing audit checklist
  - GA4 unassigned traffic fixes
  - GA4 vs CRM reconciliation
- Resources hub now supports repeatable low-cost publishing via markdown.

## Remaining optimization opportunities

1. Add proof-rich case studies with measurable outcomes.
2. Record short video explainers and embed on top-performing pages.
3. Build one downloadable template per cluster (UTM sheet, audit scorecard).
4. Run title/meta A/B refresh every 2 weeks on impression-heavy pages.
5. Add external distribution loops (LinkedIn posts, partner newsletters, niche communities).
