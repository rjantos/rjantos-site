# Inbound Acceleration Plan (Weeks, not Months)

## 1) Competitive snapshot (SERP-level)

Based on quick SERP checks for:

- b2b marketing audit
- ga4 attribution problems
- ga4 mistakes
- ga4 b2b
- b2b attribution
- utm naming convention b2b

### Repeating competitor domains

- **Analytics education leaders:** analyticsmania.com, searchenginejournal.com, support.google.com
- **B2B agencies/consultancies:** bounteous.com, tripledart.com, kalungi.com, bopdesign.com
- **Attribution software/content engines:** improvado.io, calibermind.com, utm.io, funnel.io
- **Long-tail niche experts:** independent consultants on LinkedIn/Substack/blogs

### Competitive gap map (how to outperform)

| Competitor type | Typical strength | Typical weakness | Your advantage angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large education sites | Domain authority and volume | Generic, low implementation depth | Practical diagnostics + proof-led CTA |
| Agency blogs | Broad keyword coverage | Weak founder-level voice, lower specificity | Clear operator POV + implementation-first |
| SaaS content teams | Framework-heavy resources | Tool-biased outcomes | Tool-agnostic decisions tied to pipeline |
| Solo experts | Sharp POV | Limited site architecture and conversion paths | Stronger internal linking + conversion UX + daily distribution |

## 2) How to beat them in the short term

Do **not** try to outrank broad head terms first.
Win on speed and specificity:

1. Publish high-intent pages tied to implementation outcomes.
2. Use checklist/template/fixes angles for CTR.
3. Route every page to one clear CTA (book call / offer).
4. Distribute each post aggressively (LinkedIn + communities + direct outreach).

### Market and language priority

1. **Primary:** English-speaking B2B markets (USA, UK, Canada, Ireland)
2. **Secondary:** Italian-language content for selected expansion terms
