            I’m Rudi Jantos. I help B2B teams fix tracking, attribution,
            and decision-making when ads, analytics, and CRM don’t agree.

        <p>
          Before working independently, I spent several years as Head of Marketing
          at a venture-backed B2B startup.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I led growth and analytics across markets, supported international
          expansion, and worked closely with product, sales, and leadership
          through a successful exit.
        </p>

        <p>
          That experience shaped how I work today: focus on signal, not noise,
          and build systems that still hold up when budgets, expectations,
          and accountability increase.

          What I do now
        </Text>

        <p>
          Today, I work directly with founders, operators, and small B2B teams
          who need clean data and defensible answers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m usually brought in when tracking is unreliable, attribution is
          unclear, dashboards don’t match reality, and decisions are being made
          on shaky numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is simple: make sure everyone is looking at the same numbers,
          for the same reasons, and making decisions they can stand behind.

          How I work
        </Text>

        <p class="text-base-700">
          I prioritize clarity over complexity. Clean tracking, reliable data,
          and decisions you can defend.
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3 text-base-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Signal over noise.</strong>
            I remove unnecessary tools and reports so the real drivers are visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practical execution.</strong>
            I focus on fixes that actually get implemented, not theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Systems that last.</strong>
            I design setups that still work when teams, spend, and pressure increase.
          </li>
