When **Unassigned** grows in GA4, it usually means attribution hygiene is broken.

## Quick diagnostic checklist

1. Validate UTM presence on all paid and owned campaigns
2. Check for malformed UTM values and inconsistent naming
3. Test redirects to ensure query parameters are preserved
4. Review cross-domain setup for booking/app/payment flows
5. Remove self-referrals from known internal domains
6. Confirm consent setup is not stripping context unexpectedly
7. Review channel grouping assumptions
8. Compare source/medium distribution by browser/device
9. Reconcile against CRM source data for recent pipeline records

## What to fix first

Start with UTM and redirect hygiene.
These issues create the largest and fastest attribution distortions.

## What good looks like

- Lower growth rate in Unassigned
- More stable channel trends week to week
- Better match between marketing reports and sales reality
