Content that ranks but does not convert is expensive traffic.
Use this checklist to improve both SEO and lead outcomes.

## 1) Intent alignment check

- Does each page target one primary query intent?
- Is the promise in title/H1 matched by the actual content?
- Is there a clear next action for decision-stage readers?

## 2) CTR optimization check

- Rewrite title to include a clear benefit and specificity
- Improve meta description with practical outcome language
- Add FAQ blocks for long-tail query capture

## 3) On-page authority check

- Add first-hand insights and practical examples
- Remove generic filler sections
- Add internal links to supporting cluster pages

## 4) Conversion path check

- Primary CTA appears early and near conclusion
- Secondary CTA available (email/contact)
- Related resources are linked to keep users engaged

## 5) Distribution check

- Republish key insights as LinkedIn posts
- Send top guides to your email list
- Pitch high-value guides in niche communities
