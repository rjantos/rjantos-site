If your team is generating leads but pipeline quality is inconsistent, run this audit first.

## 1) Audit lead source reliability

- Check if UTM parameters are captured into CRM fields
- Verify original source is not overwritten by later workflows
- Compare channel mix in GA4 vs CRM for recent leads

If source quality is unstable, optimization decisions will drift.

## 2) Audit conversion-point friction

- Is the main CTA obvious above the fold?
- Is the booking flow mobile-friendly and fast?
- Are contact options clear for users who do not want to book immediately?

Even small friction at this step reduces call bookings sharply.

## 3) Audit lead qualification signals

- Separate low-intent actions from high-intent actions
- Tag booked calls and qualified inquiries as key events
- Review sales feedback on lead quality weekly

## 4) Audit follow-up speed

- Track time-to-first-response
- Track show-up rate for booked calls
- Track booked call -> opportunity rate

This is where many teams leak value after acquisition.

## 5) Audit reporting governance

- One owner for funnel definitions
- One shared metric dictionary
- Weekly QA of event and source consistency
