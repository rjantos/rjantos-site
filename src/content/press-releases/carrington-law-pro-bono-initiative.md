# Carrington Law Launches Pro Bono Initiative for Small Businesses

**New York, NY – August 12, 2024** – Carrington Law today announced the launch of its comprehensive pro bono initiative designed to support small businesses facing legal challenges during economic uncertainty.

## Supporting Small Business Community

The "Business Legal Access Program" (BLAP) provides free legal consultations and basic legal services to small businesses with revenues under $5 million. The program addresses common legal issues including:

- Contract review and drafting
- Employment law compliance
- Intellectual property protection
- Business formation and governance
- Basic dispute resolution

## Impressive Early Results

In its first quarter of operation, BLAP has served over 200 small businesses across New York and Los Angeles, providing more than 500 hours of free legal services. The program has helped businesses navigate everything from lease agreements to employment disputes.

## Community Impact

"Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve access to quality legal services regardless of their size," said Managing Partner Jonathan Sullivan. "Through BLAP, we're not just providing legal help – we're investing in the future of entrepreneurship in our communities."

## Program Expansion

Based on the program's success, Carrington Law plans to expand BLAP to additional cities and increase the scope of services offered. The firm is also exploring partnerships with local business incubators and chambers of commerce to reach more entrepreneurs.

## How to Access Services

Small businesses interested in the program can apply through the Carrington Law website or contact the firm's community outreach coordinator at community@carringtonlaw.com.
